## Introduction
**CYPRESS** (City of Toronto Problem Reporting and Solution System) is designed to allow citizens to report problems that concern them about their city. Problems that can be reported to CYPRESS are any real events that involves property damage to the City of Toronto such as **utility failures, tree collapse, flooded streets, property vandalism, mould and spore growth, eroded streets and garbage/ road obstructions**. CYPRESS' mission is to make the City of Toronto a better and safer environment.

## Application Features

### 1. Home Page
The home page is the landing page of the website. In the home page, the user can log in/sign in to CYPRESS, access the FAQ section, and/or take part of a survey. If a user is unsure about a specific matter, the **FAQ section** answers the most common questions regarding CYPRESS. The **survey** is to allow feedback to continously improve CYPRESS according to the users needs. After completion, the answers to the survey are stored into the database.

### 3. Report a Problem
We used the [Mapbox GL JS API](https://docs.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/api/) to provide a user friendly map that allows the user to pinpoint the exact location of the problem that they are reporting, hence making it easier for the city workers to fix the problem as soon as possible. Reports are shown in the map using markers (Red, Blue, Green) as well as a side bar that displays recent reports along with the report type, location, and date/time it was reported. When the user clicks on **```"Click to Add a Report!"```** , they are directed to a page where they can select the type of problem, enter more information, as well as choose if they want to receive updates on the report.
