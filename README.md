Problems that can be reported to CYPRESS are any real events that involves property damage to the City of Toronto such as **utility failures, tree collapse, flooded streets, property vandalism, mould and spore growth, eroded streets and garbage/ road obstructions**.

### 3. Report a Problem
We used the [Mapbox GL JS API](https://docs.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/api/) to provide a user friendly map that allows the user to pinpoint the exact location of the problem that they are reporting, hence making it easier for the city workers to fix the problem as soon as possible.

CYPRESS will also make sure to notify the user when the city has received their report and as well if steps have been taken to solve the problem.
